how do I refactor this instead of doing alot of repeating?
what id like to say is something like R > S, S > P, P > R, and
then just refer to that. Something like
1. gets input 1 and input 2, the biggest inputs wins.
bc you have two inputfields they will be assigned to the player, so the player is the input, refer to input with player1 or player2 instead
